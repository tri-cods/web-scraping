# Web Scraping

Scraping is the practice of extracting data from web sites, often using repeatable steps to collect multiple data points of the same kind or structure. 

In this workshop, we will:
- learn about a few approaches to scraping data from the web
- Become familiar with a specific web scraping browser extension from [WebScraper.io](https://webscraper.io)
- Attempt to scrape data from a website (and hopefully succeed!) and save the data as a spreadsheet
