# Web Scraping

Scraping is the practice of extracting data from web sites, using repetitive steps to collect data points from a single page or multiple pages.

In this workshop, we will:
- Learn about a few approaches to scraping data from the web
- Become familiar with a specific web scraping browser extension from [WebScraper.io](https://webscraper.io)
- Attempt to scrape data from a website (and hopefully succeed!) and save the data as a spreadsheet
