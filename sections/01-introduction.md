# What is web scraping?

Scraping is the practice of extracting data from web sites, often using repeatable tasks to pull multiple data points of the same kind or structure. We already do this all the time! When we need to grab a few phone numbers or addresses from a web page, we often use our mouse, keyboard, or other input devices to copy-and-paste data from the page into a note, spreadsheet, or document. 

# Why is scraping data useful?

Because it allows us to collect data that’s already publicly available, but in a way that lends it to computational analysis. Ideally, all websites that display lots of structured data would also make it available via download in a variety of formats (CSV, Excel Spreadsheet, etc.). But we do not live in an ideal world! Some sites do not offer a download option, some sites/services put up paywalls or other barriers to bulk data downloads. 

We’ve all had to repetitively copy-and-paste information from one source to another. Scraping is a way of grabbing data in a methodical and repeatable way. It leverages HTML markup to target specific spans of text in the document (a number, a name, a URL to an image, etc.)
